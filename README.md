# C Programming in 1 Week
Welcome to the "C Programming in 1 Week" repository! This crash course is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of the C programming language. Each day, we'll cover essential topics, and by the end of the week, you'll have a solid understanding of C and be able to work on a mini project to apply your newly acquired knowledge. Let's get started!

## Day 1: Introduction, Keywords & Data Types
On Day 1, we'll begin by getting familiar with the basics of C programming.

### Topics Covered:
Introduction to C programming language
Setting up the development environment
Keywords and identifiers in C
Variables and constants
Basic data types in C
Input and output in C (printf, scanf)


## Day 2: Operators, Control Flow, and Loops
On Day 2, we'll dive into operators and control flow statements, essential for making decisions and repetitive tasks.

### Topics Covered:
Arithmetic, relational, logical, and assignment operators
If-else statements for decision-making
The 'for' loop for iterative tasks
The 'while' loop for conditional looping
Using 'break' and 'continue' in loops
Switch-case statement for multiway branching


## Day 3: Functions, Recursion, and Storage Class
Day 3 will focus on functions, recursion, and storage class, enabling you to write modular and efficient code.

### Topics Covered:
Introduction to functions and their advantages
Creating and using user-defined functions
Recursion: A function calling itself
Understanding storage classes (auto, static, extern, register)
Scope and lifetime of variables


## Day 4: Arrays, Pointers, and Dynamic Memory Allocation
Day 4 will explore arrays, pointers, and dynamic memory allocation, essential concepts for handling data efficiently.

### Topics Covered:
Working with arrays in C
Multi-dimensional arrays and their applications
Pointers: Understanding memory addresses
Pointers and arrays: Relationship and applications
Dynamic memory allocation using malloc and free


## Day 5: Strings and Structures
On Day 5, we'll delve into strings and structures, allowing you to handle text and create complex data structures.

### Topics Covered:
Working with strings in C
String functions and operations
Introduction to structures (structs)
Accessing structure members
Passing structures to functions


## Day 6: File Handling and Preprocessors
Day 6 will cover file handling and preprocessors, enabling you to work with external files and perform preprocessing tasks.

### Topics Covered:
Reading and writing files in C
Using file pointers for file operations
Introduction to preprocessor directives
Commonly used preprocessor directives


## Day 7: Mini Project
On Day 7, it's time to put your skills to the test with a mini project!

### Mini Project Ideas:
Choose one of the following or create your own project:

Simple address book: Create a program to store and manage contact information.
Text-based game: Develop a simple text-based game using C.
File encryption/decryption: Create a program to encrypt and decrypt files.
